        <p>
            Shea nuts, harvested from the African Shea tree (<em>Vitellaria paradoxa</em>), are among Ghana's most valuable natural resources. These nuts are the foundation of a multi-billion dollar industry that has sustained communities in Northern Ghana for over a millennium. Often called "women's gold," shea nuts provide the primary income source for over 1.8 million women across the region.
        </p>

        
        <h3>History and Origin in Ghana</h3>
        <p>
            The Shea tree is indigenous to the African Sahel, stretching across 21 countries from Senegal to Sudan. In Ghana, shea trees have grown naturally in the Northern, Upper East, Upper West, and parts of the Brong-Ahafo regions for thousands of years. Archaeological evidence suggests that local communities have been processing shea nuts for over 1,000 years, with knowledge passed down through generations of women.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tree was considered sacred by many ethnic groups, including the Dagara, Mamprusi, and Gonja people, who believed it brought prosperity and fertility to the land. Colonial records from the early 1900s document extensive shea butter trade, indicating its economic importance long before international recognition.

        <ol style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
            <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Women gather fallen nuts during the dry season (May-September)</li>
            <li><strong>Drying:</strong> Nuts are sun-dried for several days to reduce moisture content</li>
            <li><strong>Cracking:</strong> Hard shells are carefully cracked to extract the kernels</li>
            <li><strong>Roasting:</strong> Kernels are roasted in large clay pots to develop flavor and reduce moisture</li>

            <li><strong>Kneading:</strong> The paste is kneaded by hand with small amounts of water</li>
            <li><strong>Boiling:</strong> The mixture is boiled, and the fat separates and rises to the surface</li>
            <li><strong>Collection:</strong> Pure shea butter is skimmed off and molded into blocks</li>
        </ol>
