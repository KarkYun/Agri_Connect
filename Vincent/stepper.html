        <p>
          Pineapple (<em>Ananas comosus</em>) is one of Ghana's most important
          cash crops, renowned for its sweet taste and high export value.
          Introduced to Ghana centuries ago, pineapple farming has become a
          major source of income for thousands of smallholder farmers and
          large-scale producers alike. The crop thrives in Ghana's tropical
          climate, especially in the Eastern, Central, and Volta regions.

        <h2>Economic Importance</h2>
        <p>
          Pineapple is a key contributor to Ghana's agricultural exports, second
          only to cocoa in terms of foreign exchange earnings from horticultural
          crops. The industry provides employment for over 15,000 people
          directly and many more indirectly through processing, packaging, and
          transportation. Ghanaian pineapples are highly sought after in
          European markets due to their unique sweetness and quality.

            Major export destinations: European Union (especially the UK,
            Germany, and France), Middle East, and regional West African
            markets.

        <h2>Pineapple Varieties Grown in Ghana</h2>
        <p>
          Ghana is known for cultivating several pineapple varieties, each with
          distinct characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Smooth Cayenne</strong>: The most widely grown, known for
            its juiciness and suitability for canning and fresh consumption.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>MD2</strong>: A newer, export-oriented variety prized for
            its extra sweetness, golden color, and longer shelf life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Queen</strong>: Smaller, aromatic, and very sweet, often
            sold in local markets.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Production and Processing</h2>
        <p>
          Pineapple farming in Ghana ranges from small family plots to large
          commercial plantations. The crop is grown year-round, with peak
          harvests between March-June and September-December. After harvesting,
          pineapples are sorted, cleaned, and either exported fresh or processed
          into juice, dried fruit, and canned products.
        </p>

          class="img-center"
        />
        <p>
          Processing adds value and creates jobs in rural communities. Ghana has
          several modern pineapple processing factories, producing juice and
          other products for both local and international markets.
